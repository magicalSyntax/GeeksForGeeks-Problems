You are given a string s. Your task is to determine if the string is a palindrome. A string is considered a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards.

Examples :
Input: s = "abba"
Output: true
Explanation: "abba" reads the same forwards and backwards, so it is a palindrome.
Input: s = "abc" 
Output: false
Explanation: "abc" does not read the same forwards and backwards, so it is not a palindrome.

Constraints:
1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 106
The string s contains only lowercase english letters (a-z).

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)

<Code>
class Solution {
  public:
    bool isPalindrome(string& s) {
        // code here
        string sCopy = s;
        reverse(s.begin(), s.end());
        if(s == sCopy) return true;
        else return false;
    }
};
