Given a string s of lowercase alphabets. The task is to find the maximum occurring character in the string s. If more than one character occurs the maximum number of times then print the lexicographically smaller character.

Examples:
Input: s = "testsample"
Output: 'e'
Explanation: 'e' is the character which is having the highest frequency.
Input: s = "output"
Output: 't'
Explanation: 't' and 'u' are the characters with the same frequency, but 't' is lexicographically smaller.

Constraints:
1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)

class Solution {
  public:
    char getMaxOccuringChar(string& s) {
        //  code here
        int freq[26] = {0};
        for(char c: s){
            freq[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        int maxfreq = 0;
        char result;
        for(int i = 0; i < 26; i++){
            if(maxfreq < freq[i]){
                maxfreq = freq[i];
                result = i + 'a';
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
