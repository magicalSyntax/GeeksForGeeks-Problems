Given a sorted array arr[] and an integer x, find the index (0-based) of the smallest element in arr[] that is greater than or equal to x. This element is called the ceil of x. If such an element does not exist, return -1.

Note: In case of multiple occurrences of ceil of x, return the index of the first occurrence.

Examples
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], x = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Smallest number greater than 5 is 8, whose index is 2.
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], x = 20
Output: -1
Explanation: No element greater than 20 is found. So output is -1.
Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 2, 8, 10, 11, 12, 19], x = 0
Output: 0
Explanation: Smallest number greater than 0 is 1, whose indices are 0 and 1. The index of the first occurrence is 0.

Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 106
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 106
0 ≤ x ≤ arr[n-1]

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(log n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)

        int low = 0, high = n-1, mid, ans = -1;

        while(low <= high){
            mid = (low+high) / 2;

            if(arr[mid] >= x){
                ans = mid;
                high = mid - 1;
            } else{
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
