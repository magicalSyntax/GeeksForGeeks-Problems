Given an increasing sorted rotated array arr[] of distinct integers. The array is right-rotated k times. Find the value of k.
Let's suppose we have an array arr[] = [2, 4, 6, 9], if we rotate it by 2 times it will look like this:
After 1st Rotation : [9, 2, 4, 6]
After 2nd Rotation : [6, 9, 2, 4]

Examples:
Input: arr[] = [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 1
Explanation: The given array is [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]. The original sorted array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. We can see that the array was rotated 1 times to the right.
Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: 0
Explanation: The given array is not rotated.

Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 107

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(log n)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)

<Code>
class Solution {
  public:
    int findKRotation(vector<int> &arr) {
        // Code Here
        int n = arr.size();
        int low = 0, high = n-1;
        
        while(low < high){
            int mid = (low+high) /2;
            
            if(arr[mid] > arr[high]){
                low = mid + 1;
            }else 
                high = mid;
        }
        return low;
    }
};
