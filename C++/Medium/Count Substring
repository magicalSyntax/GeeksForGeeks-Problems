Given string s consisting only a,b,c. return the number of substrings containing at least one occurrence of all these characters a, b, and c.

Example 1:
Input:
abcabc
Output:
10
Explanation:
The required substrings  are "abc", "abca", "abcab", "abcabc",
"bca", "bcab", "bcabc", "cab", "cabc" and "abc".

Example 2:
Input:
aaacb
Output:
3
Your Task:
You don't have to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function countSubstring() which takes the string s and returns the count of substring having at least a,b,c.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Space Complexity: O(1)

Constraint:
3<=s.length<=5 x 104  
S only contains a,b,c.

<Code>
class Solution {
  public:
    int countSubstring(string s) {
        // Code here
        int n = s.size(), count = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            int freq[3] = {0};
            for(int j = i; j < n; j++){
                freq[s[j] - 'a'] = 1;
                if(freq[0] + freq[1] + freq[2] == 3){
                    count += (n-j);
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
