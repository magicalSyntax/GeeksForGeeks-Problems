Given an array arr[] of non-negative integers. Find the length of the longest sub-sequence such that elements in the subsequence are consecutive integers, the consecutive numbers can be in any order.

Examples:
Input: arr[] = [2, 6, 1, 9, 4, 5, 3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The consecutive numbers here are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. These 6 numbers form the longest consecutive subsquence.
Input: arr[] = [1, 9, 3, 10, 4, 20, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: 1, 2, 3, 4 is the longest consecutive subsequence.
Input: arr[] = [15, 13, 12, 14, 11, 10, 9]
Output: 7
Explanation: The longest consecutive subsequence is 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, which has a length of 7.

Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(n)
Auxiliary Space: O(n)

class Solution {
  public:

    // Function to return length of longest subsequence of consecutive integers.
    int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& arr) {
        // Your code here
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        int count = 1, last_smaller = arr[0], max_count=1;
        for(int i = 1; i < arr.size(); i++){
            if(last_smaller == arr[i]){
                continue;
            } else if(last_smaller + 1 == arr[i]){
                count++;
                last_smaller++;
                if(max_count < count) max_count=count;
            } else {
                count = 1;
                last_smaller = arr[i];
            }
        }
        return max_count;
    }
};
